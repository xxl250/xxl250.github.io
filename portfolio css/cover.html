              <p>I'm Xiao Lyu. My first learning of film producing started from the summer session on Film and TV Production at
University of California Los Angeles in 2014. Then I transferred to University of Miami from Macau
University of Science and Technology. Wanting to enter the film industry, I spend much of my spare time in watching films, no matter
Chinese or western. However, in modern society, more and more films tend to be commercial and
entertainment-oriented. I donâ€™t want to see that film was just a business tool to make money for the
issuers. I think the real successful films could bring some positive effects and trigger some thinking
for the spectators.</p>
