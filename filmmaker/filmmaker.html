              <p>A boy is locked in a sauna room when he is having a sauna; then he is dead and becomes an evil in the sauna room which seduces and kills people.
I wrote this original story from the inspiration of several horror and suspense masters.
One of them who gives me motivation is Stephen King. King is good at turning the everyday goods to the evil of his story and it inspires me to write about a scary Sauna room.

             <p>Wilma uses a magic remoter to fast forward or pauses a tea party with Florrie Smith and thus it becomes a satire on insincere flattery.
 Fast Forward Friends talks about a story which aims at a life control remoter. The protagonist tells the truth when she pauses the others movement and when the remoter is broken, her true feeling is heard by the others.</p> </p>
